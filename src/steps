<!-- I structured my folder like this; then, I will copy necessary files for the time.

1, I will create a PHP file for defining plugin constants: wp-react-dashboard.php.
2, I will create a class file to create the admin dashboard page: class-create-admin-menu.
3,I will create a "component" folder in my "src" directory and place the Dashboard React component inside the "component" folder.
4,Run npm install.
5,Create an index.js file for creating the React component by ID.
6,Create an app.js file that calls my component.
7,Run npm run build.
8,Once the dist files are generated, I will start my server.
so This is all Thanks !
